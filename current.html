<h2>Game design, has now been perfected down to a science. Now, even the most casual gamer knows what they want to look for in a video game. Thanks to the trial and error of the past, as well as gaming becoming a common hobby, quality in video games is much easier to spot. <br> <br> What also helps is the internet, and it's contributing to gaming reviews. Meaning there can easily be whole communities around video games and their effect on fans. Just years ago, we were still trying to master 3D, or figure out a rewarding gameplay loop to keep customers coming back. </h2>
<br>
<h2>Creators know what fans want to see in their products. Now you'll see developers who want to make a worth while game put in modes just for hardcore fans, giving them reason to continue enjoying the product. Weather it be a 'speedrun' challenge, tasking players to show their mastery by clearing the game as fast as possible, or a more difficult mode for that extra level of expertice. It shows that game developers have cracked the code to make their game enjoyable for everyone, short term and long term.</h2>
