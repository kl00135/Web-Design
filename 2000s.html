<h2>The early 2000s were a time of their own. A time before the accessibility of technology, yet also a time of advancing promise of a smart-tech future. Gone were the grounded aesthetics of the 90s, as clear landscapes, and bright colored glossy effects were in the now.</h2>

<h2>This clean, clear image was also reflected in the video gaming industry. The consoles of the 90s were solid colors, and transparent, but lacked the futuristic feeling of this era's releases.</h2>

<h2>All of this to showcase how gaming did not only change from within from a game design perspective, but it also adapted with the times in terms of visuals. As technology improved, as did gaming.</h2>
<br>
<h2>Another very important factor of this generation of gaming, is that these years are what really brought the hobby from a one player activity, to a widespread family pass time. These consoles and their widespread reach are what brought gaming into a whole new level. The Nintendo Wii alone sold <b>101 million</b> units, because of it's catering towards being a console both casual and hardcore fans can enjoy! Gaming was getting to be a staple household feature.</h2>
