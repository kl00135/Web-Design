        <h2>The world of gaming is vast and rich with history that effected it's course as a medium of entertainment. Because of this non-linear way of progression we have with gaming as a whole, for some, experiencing the games of days past has become impossible for some
        individuals. The industry has built upon itself for what makes a modern day video game, and because of this quality-increasing standard, companies like Nintendo or Sony have become reluctant to release their history in a format that a casual viewer can experience. This is why this site exists. I would like to share with you, the ins and outs of what can be considered now as "<u>Retro Gaming</u>". </h2>
